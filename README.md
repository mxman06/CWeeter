CWeeter
=======

Mini project that me and @Tumeconnais had to do for during our second Master degress's year for the Grails learning.

##It's a mini Twitter like, where it is possible to

  -Register/login with a username and a password.
  
  -Loggoff (kill the session from the website)
  
  -Follow/unfollow  another user
  
  -Type some "cweets" and it gonna be for all user who are following me
  
  -See all the "cweets" that we made, and all from our follows
  
  -Search some users typing a username like
  

##We implemented some technicals features that were required :

  -Mapping URL
  
  -Bootstrap initial datas
  
  -Generate views and controllers via IntelliJIdea
  
  -Define a model with constraints


##Specifications on this project
  
  -We didn't take in account the "group" thing that was asked by the teacher, we forgot to include this feature in this project because we were to focus to fork the real simple Twitter system which is to following/be fllowed other users.
  
  -We used an H2 DB
