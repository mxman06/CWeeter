Mini project that me and @Tumeconnais had to do for during our second Master degress's year for the Grails learning.

It's a mini Twitter like, where it is possible to
  -Register/login with a username and a password.
  -Loggoff (kill the session from the website)
  -Follow/unfollow  another user
  -Type some "cweets" and it gonna be for all user who are following me
  -See all the "cweets" that we made, and all from our follows
  -Search some users typing a username like

We implemented some technicals features that were required : 
  -Mapping URL
  -Bootstrap initial datas
  -Generate views and controllers via IntelliJIdea
